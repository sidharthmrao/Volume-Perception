Box Experiment - Sidharth Rao and Ryan Yang

In this project, we investigate the function f with gives perceived volume = f(l,w,h), where l,w,h are the length,width, and height of a box. To do this, we create an interface where participants are shown two boxes with different l,w,h values, and asked which one they think has a larger volume.
